# Object Detection GUI with YOLOv8 and Text Recognition

## Description
This project consists of multiple components, including:
1. **Object detection** using YOLOv8 model in real-time through webcam or video file.
2. **Face matching** between two images using OpenCV and a face embedding model.
3. **Text recognition** from images using EasyOCR.

The project is implemented with a graphical user interface (GUI) using CustomTkinter, allowing users to select video files or use their webcam for object detection. Additionally, users can perform face matching and text extraction from images.

## Requirements
To run this application, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

### Python Dependencies
Install the following packages using `pip`:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy torch easyocr customtkinter ultralytics
```

The application will launch with a GUI. You can select video files for object detection, use the webcam for real-time detection, or perform face matching and text recognition using image files.
